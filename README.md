# RVO2IntegrationTutorial
simple project that uses RVO2 with Unity

This is a simple integration of the RVO2 library into Unity 3D game engine. It uses the circle scene example described in the Circle.cs file
in the RVO2 C# library version 2.0.1. 

I do not own the implementation for RVO2. See their website for further information: http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO2/
